## Sample data (for reviewers)

Raw scraped data is excluded from git (`data/raw/`) to keep the repository small and avoid sharing scraped content.
A small, representative sample is included under `data/sample/` so reviewers can inspect the schema and run the loader/tests quickly.

- Sample JSON: `data/sample/telegram_messages/2021-10-28/sample_channel.json` (5–20 rows)
- (Optional) Sample image: `data/sample/images/sample_channel/102.jpg`
